This report documents the work carried out in the creation of an internal navigation mobile application that makes exclusive use of a smartphone's intertial sensors, built for navigation through the University of Warwick's Computer Science Department building. This involves the use of a custom built step detector to register movement and the compass to measure a user's heading. This is followed by an analysis of its overall performance and a critique of the software development resources provided for both iPhone and Android application development, primarily through the Xamarin development kit.
